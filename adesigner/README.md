## Guideline


To use the application, you must first log in as a member. We kindly ask you to create a membership with company information. Please indicate if you are registering as a publisher or advertiser when registering. If you do not specify, you will automatically be a visitor and the like-template function will not be defined for you but you will still be able to observe the name templates on our page.

You can browse templates after you log in. A homepage welcomes you for this. If you are a publisher or advertiser you can like the templates that you can use so that the other members can reach your information.

To reach the templates you have already liked and see the other companies that liked that template, you can use the favorites page.
